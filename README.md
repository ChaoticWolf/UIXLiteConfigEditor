# UIX Lite Config Editor
This tool allows you to create and edit the config file of the UIX Lite dashboard (previously UIX Ultra Lite) on your computer. You can also download the config and upload it to your Xbox using another dashboard's FTP server.

FTP config download and upload tested to work with UnleashX and XBMC. Other dashboards may not work currently.

Config files are downloaded from C:\UIX Configs on the Xbox. This is where UIX Lite as of v0.4 keeps its config.

For adding game and app icons to UIX Lite, check out Iconinator by MobCat:
